Install and Setup
=================

Install
-------

For now, clone the `source code <https://github.com/dougroyal/scm-cli>`_, and run

.. code:: bash

    # python setup.py install

In a few days, I'll publish this to pypi, which will allow you to run.

.. code:: bash

    # pip install scm_cli

Setup
-----

Edit the config file:

~/.scm/scm.cfg

Uncomment hosts you want to use, and add the necessary credentials.
